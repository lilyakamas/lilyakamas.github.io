<!-- Documentation is a critical part of this course and it is done best when you have a dedicated setup or space for documenting while you work. This week, consider where you will be working on projects for this class and explore several options for capturing and documentation (e.g. photography, video).

Your goal is to find the setup that offers you the most quality for least effort. This may include a well lit tripod setup over your workstation (or maybe a headlamp?), a dedicated backdrop, a dedicated folder for class photos on your computer.

Find something in your house that is woven. Take at least three photos of it to explore what works best for showing overall structure, detail, etc. What images give you the best view of the fabric structure?  -->
