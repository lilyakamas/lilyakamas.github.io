<!-- Documentation is a critical part of this course and it is done best when you have a dedicated setup or space for documenting while you work. This week, consider where you will be working on projects for this class and explore several options for capturing and documentation (e.g. photography, video).

Your goal is to find the setup that offers you the most quality for least effort. This may include a well lit tripod setup over your workstation (or maybe a headlamp?), a dedicated backdrop, a dedicated folder for class photos on your computer.

Find something in your house that is woven. Take at least three photos of it to explore what works best for showing overall structure, detail, etc. What images give you the best view of the fabric structure?  -->

<h3>Creative Space & Documentation Possibilities</h3>
<p><h2>What are you setting out to do?</h2></p>
		<p> During this week, I hope to recognize the space I have around me and begin to prepare for this upcoming semesters assignments.</p>

<p><h2>Process Notes</h2></p>
		<p> I have a woven phone cord that is supposed to be resistant to tearing/exposing the wires. I'm sure the plastic is just wrapped with this woven texture, but it would be interesting to see if it was just the woven shell with the wires directly inside. I noticed there was some fraying near the end that would usually be impacted by general use (and would possibly tear/expose the wires on a regular cord). Regardless it is tight-knit, the material is somewhat reflective, and it is woven in a chevron-type design pattern. There are about ten rows around the circumference of the cord, and it is about six feet long. </p> 
		<p> As far as future documentation goes, I am not sure how to upload video, and google doc’s doesn’t support ‘live photos’. I have ‘still photos’ for now, but I am sure my documentation style will update. </p>

<p><h2>Reflection</h2></p>
		<p> My main space this semester will be at my dining room table, in the center of my apartment. Due to some of my crafts, I have a nice headlamp that I acquired specifically for crafting use. Additionally, I have a super bright desk lamp (for my puzzles) and a bright overhead light. To keep my home projects separate from school, I will go to Goodwill this week and buy a dedicated wicker basket for both projects. </p>
		<p> While my concentration is more focused while I sit at my desk, sitting there for hours can be quite uncomfortable. Therefore I have a second dedicated space that is more comfortable, my couch. I have an extra pillow for back support and an additional pillow to put on my coffee table to protect my legs (and keep them comfortable)! Finally, I have a dedicated space on my computer to keep all class files, including all of the photos I use, and I’ve decided to use a large notebook to take my photos for a clean background </p>
