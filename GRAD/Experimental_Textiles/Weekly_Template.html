		<p><h1>Weekly Template</h1>


<!-- Each weekly will give you a prompt and a technique to use. In your assignment turn turn in, you’ll will describe what you did. This template is about process. Process means the journey you follow when attempting an assignment, not just the ending point. All the things that you do that go well, inspire a next step, or go not as you planed and either cause you to change your direction. All these experiences are equally valuable as long as we document and share them with each other. To borrow, again, from Corita Kent’s rules for an art studio, “the only rule is work”. With that in mind, we want you to submit the following for each of your weeklies: --> 

<h3>Weekly Name</h3>
<h3>Lily Kamas</h3>

<p><h2>What are you setting out to do?</h2></p>
		<p> Before you start working, tell us where you are starting: Give us a 2-3 sentence description of what you think you might try and/or draw us a diagram of what you are going to make. Your description may include responses to any of the following: describe materials you’ll play with and why you chose those materials, if you have an idea of what you want to make, describe your vision. Describe what would you want to come out of this assignment and how would it be valuable to you? Did something in the reading inspire you? Did something you saw in the world give you an idea? Spoiler Alert, you will likely not get what you envision, and that’s the fun of it. Sometimes you just need a place to start but be generous and let yourself wander as new ideas come to mind.</p>

<p><h2>Process Notes</h2></p>
		<p> Its critical to make observations and take time while you are exploring materials and techniques. We want to submit a collection (at least three, but more are welcome) of your notes on process. Each note should include a photo and an observation or idea that emerged.</p>

<p><h2>Reflection</h2></p>
		<p> A weekly that is generative would give you lots of ideas that you’d want to explore if you had the time. It would fuel visions of new things you’d like to make. A non-generative assignment might leave you feeling a bit blah, like you don’t feel like you really got much from the processes or you are feeling much more limited in what you think you might do next. Write 2-3 sentences reflecting on what you learned about the materials, how generative those findings were in your own creative process.
