<h3><em>Cricket Loom - September 12 2022</em></h3>
<h3>by Lily Kamas & Nik </h3>


<p><h2>What are you setting out to do?</h2></p>
		<!-- <p> Before you start working, tell us where you are starting: Give us a 2-3 sentence description of what you think you might try and/or draw us a diagram of what you are going to make. Your description may include responses to any of the following: describe materials you’ll play with and why you chose those materials, if you have an idea of what you want to make, describe your vision. Describe what would you want to come out of this assignment and how would it be valuable to you? Did something in the reading inspire you? Did something you saw in the world give you an idea? Spoiler Alert, you will likely not get what you envision, and that’s the fun of it. Sometimes you just need a place to start but be generous and let yourself wander as new ideas come to mind.</p> -->
		<p>This week ... </p>


<p><h2>Process Notes</h2></p>
		<p> We began working on our Cricket Loom in class on September 7th, 2022. After my partner and I assembled the loom, we started setting the warp on the heddle. We also marked the middle of our heddle and where we wanted to begin and end our warp threads. After threading it through the slots, we cut off the yarn from the end pedestal and wrapped up the warn using the rachet. Once that was complete we started brining one strand through each hole, and then finally tying them to the pole with a surgens knot (for easy tightning-tune-ups later). At this point, our loom was ready for wefts but our class time had run out. Unfortunately, I am going to be gone this weekend working in Grand Junction so scheduling time with my partner may prove to be challenging. </p>

<p><h2>Reflection</h2></p>
		<p> A weekly that is generative would give you lots of ideas that you’d want to explore if you had the time. It would fuel visions of new things you’d like to make. A non-generative assignment might leave you feeling a bit blah, like you don’t feel like you really got much from the processes or you are feeling much more limited in what you think you might do next. Write 2-3 sentences reflecting on what you learned about the materials, how generative those findings were in your own creative process.
