<h3><em>Cricket Loom - 12 September 2022</em></h3>
<h3>by Lily Kamas & Nik </h3>


<p><h2>What are you setting out to do?</h2></p>
		<!-- <p> Before you start working, tell us where you are starting: Give us a 2-3 sentence description of what you think you might try and/or draw us a diagram of what you are going to make. Your description may include responses to any of the following: describe materials you’ll play with and why you chose those materials, if you have an idea of what you want to make, describe your vision. Describe what would you want to come out of this assignment and how would it be valuable to you? Did something in the reading inspire you? Did something you saw in the world give you an idea? Spoiler Alert, you will likely not get what you envision, and that’s the fun of it. Sometimes you just need a place to start but be generous and let yourself wander as new ideas come to mind.</p> -->

		This week I want to learn how to warp a loom properly and have an effective tabby weave. We are using the yarn originally found in the cricket loom box, but I also brought some extra fun yarn that gave us different textures. I enjoyed using the yarn in my Book Loom to add more texture and dimension. I focus on getting the weave's rhythm and ensuring the tension and warp work correctly. I would love to buy my cricket loom to make garments for my family members. Steven Frost mentioned he brings his cricket loom to hotels & airb'n'b's while traveling to make scarves for relatives. I like the concept of easily creating something that could be used and valued in numerous ways. </p>


<p><h2>Process Notes</h2></p>
		<p> We began working on our Cricket Loom in class on Wednesday (9/7). After my partner and I assembled the loom, we started setting the warp on the heddle. We also marked the middle of our heddle and where we wanted to begin and end our warp threads. After threading it through the slots, we cut off the yarn from the end pedestal and wrapped up the yarn using the rachet. Once that was complete, we started bringing one strand through each hole and then tying them to the pole with a surgeon's knot (for easy tightening-tune-ups later). Our loom was ready for wefts at this point, but our class time had run out. Unfortunately, I am out of town this weekend working in Grand Junction, so scheduling time with my partner may prove to be challenging. I created some unique patterns and bulges with the purple yarn during the weaving I completed. </p>

<p><h2>Reflection</h2></p>
		<p> <!-- A weekly that is generative would give you lots of ideas that you’d want to explore if you had the time. It would fuel visions of new things you’d like to make. A non-generative assignment might leave you feeling a bit blah, like you don’t feel like you really got much from the processes or you are feeling much more limited in what you think you might do next. Write 2-3 sentences reflecting on what you learned about the materials, how generative those findings were in your own creative process. -->


The process throughout this week was a bit difficult; I had to leave town Wednesday after class and come back on Monday morning before class. Because of this, I could not create extensive weaving or complete the assignment. I worked a bit in class on Monday (9/12) to practice better using the loom. I wove with a few different materials, including a type of fluffy-fishnet yarn and toilet paper. I could not use the conductive thread due to time and accessibility constraints. I would 10/10 do this assignment again and use more difficult weaving styles rather than a basic tabby weave. I learned a lot by being able to work on this loom with a heddle; it has completely expanded my ways of knowing how textiles are made and the history and legacy of looms and different forms of weaving. As I learn and become more comfortable with weaving techniques, I fully expect the cricket loom to become a significant part of my crafting life.
