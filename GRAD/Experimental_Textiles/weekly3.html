<h3><em>Cricket Loom - 12 September 2022</em></h3>
<h3>by Lily Kamas & Nik </h3>


<p><h2>What are you setting out to do?</h2></p>
		<!-- <p> Before you start working, tell us where you are starting: Give us a 2-3 sentence description of what you think you might try and/or draw us a diagram of what you are going to make. Your description may include responses to any of the following: describe materials you’ll play with and why you chose those materials, if you have an idea of what you want to make, describe your vision. Describe what would you want to come out of this assignment and how would it be valuable to you? Did something in the reading inspire you? Did something you saw in the world give you an idea? Spoiler Alert, you will likely not get what you envision, and that’s the fun of it. Sometimes you just need a place to start but be generous and let yourself wander as new ideas come to mind.</p> -->

		This week I hope to learn how to properly warp a loom and have an effective tabby weave. We are using the yarn originally found in the cricket loom box, but I also brought some extra fun yarn that gave us some different texture. I enjoyed using the yarn I used in my Book Loom to add more texture and dimension. I am focused on getting the rythm of the weave and making sure the tension and warp works correctly. I would love to buy my own cricket loom to make garments for my family members. Steven Frost mentioned he brings his cricket loom to hotels & airb'n'b's while traveling to make scarves for relatives. I like the concept of being able to easily create something which could be used and valued in numerous ways. </p>


<p><h2>Process Notes</h2></p>
		<p> We began working on our Cricket Loom in class on Wednesday (9/7). After my partner and I assembled the loom, we started setting the warp on the heddle. We also marked the middle of our heddle and where we wanted to begin and end our warp threads. After threading it through the slots, we cut off the yarn from the end pedestal and wrapped up the warn using the rachet. Once that was complete we started brining one strand through each hole, and then finally tying them to the pole with a surgens knot (for easy tightning-tune-ups later). At this point, our loom was ready for wefts but our class time had run out. Unfortunately, I am out of town this weekend working in Grand Junction so scheduling time with my partner may prove to be challenging. During the weaving I did complete, I was able to create some unique patterns and buldges with the purple yarn. </p>

<p><h2>Reflection</h2></p>
		<p> <!-- A weekly that is generative would give you lots of ideas that you’d want to explore if you had the time. It would fuel visions of new things you’d like to make. A non-generative assignment might leave you feeling a bit blah, like you don’t feel like you really got much from the processes or you are feeling much more limited in what you think you might do next. Write 2-3 sentences reflecting on what you learned about the materials, how generative those findings were in your own creative process. -->

The process throughout this week was a bit difficult, I ended up having to leave town Wednesday after class and coming back on Monday morning before class. Because of this I was unable to create extensive weaving or truly complete the assignment. I worked a bit in class on Monday (9/12) to get better practice of actually using the loom. I wove with a few different materials, including a type of fluffy-fishnet yarn and toilet paper. I was unable to use conductive yarn due to time and accessibility contraints. I would 10/10 do this assignment again, and try to use more difficult weaving styles rather than a basic tabby weave. I learned a lot by being able to work on this loom with a heddle, it has completely expanded my ways of knowing for how textiles are made and the history and legacy of looms and different forms of weaving. As I learn and become more comfortable with techniques of weaving, I fully expect for the cricket loom to become a major part of my crafting life.
