<h3><em>Make your own Loom</em></h3>
<h3>by Lily Kamas</h3>

<!-- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO18mP51RBI&t=1s
	Repeat the process to make a loom with the following specifications. 

	Your loom should have at least 20 ends/warps and use at least 2 colors. Weave two colors in any combination in the weft. Integrate at least 12" of conductive yarn or thread into the weave by any means you imagine. Weave something that relates to the contents of the book. Ask yourself, what else could you make a loom out of?  --> 

<p><h2>What are you setting out to do?</h2></p>
		<!-- <p> Before you start working, tell us where you are starting: Give us a 2-3 sentence description of what you think you might try and/or draw us a diagram of what you are going to make. Your description may include responses to any of the following: describe materials you’ll play with and why you chose those materials, if you have an idea of what you want to make, describe your vision. Describe what would you want to come out of this assignment and how would it be valuable to you? Did something in the reading inspire you? Did something you saw in the world give you an idea? Spoiler Alert, you will likely not get what you envision, and that’s the fun of it. Sometimes you just need a place to start but be generous and let yourself wander as new ideas come to mind.-->
		<p>I was a bit worried about the beginning of this project because I had to miss class on 8/31 due to a medical appointment (#bonegraft).</p>
		
		<p> For this experiment, I have collected some different types of <em>book weaver's (bookmark, chopstick</em>. I also chose my book, and it is the most recent book I've read, called <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28257707-the-subtle-art-of-not-giving-a-f-ck "><em>"The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F**k"</em></a> by Mark Manson. I traveled to Art Parts in Boulder, Colorado to aquire some donated yarn. I gathered a multi-colored blue cotton yarn, a shiny crimped white yarn, and finally a multi-thread purple yarn cluster. </p>

<p><h2>Process Notes</h2></p>
		<p> Its critical to make observations and take time while you are exploring materials and techniques. We want to submit a collection (at least three, but more are welcome) of your notes on process. Each note should include a photo and an observation or idea that emerged.

		 I spent a while trying to figure out the right technique, especially since I have quite long nails. I eventually ended up using an extra thick needle and tweezers to help me pick up each individual warp. 
		 After setting everything up, I started wefting with this beautiful purple yarn. After an inch or so, I went back and added some multi-colored blye yarn to tie everything together. </p>

			<p>I was also trying a few new types of documentation during this project, including the use of a tri-pod, artifical lighting and using time-lapse/gif content. </p>

<p><h2>Reflection</h2></p>
		
		<!-- A weekly that is generative would give you lots of ideas that you’d want to explore if you had the time. It would fuel visions of new things you’d like to make. A non-generative assignment might leave you feeling a bit blah, like you don’t feel like you really got much from the processes or you are feeling much more limited in what you think you might do next. Write 2-3 sentences reflecting on what you learned about the materials, how generative those findings were in your own creative process. -->

			 I enjoyed this project from the get-go, especially sourcing the materials. Going to Art Parts was a super fun experience, and I embodied the purpose of the book by choosing materials that made me the most excited to work with, regardless of their texture, color or shape. I struggled in the beginning because I wasn't using the right materials to move the loom, which made it difficult to pick up the correct set of warps. Not all of my wefts were completely perfect, but I think that it still looked quite nice, espeically the purple bundled yarn strands. With the purpose of the book on my mindset, I focused on embracing the process instead of focusing on the imperfections. 

			 If I had more time on this assignment, I would want to try more weaving patterns, but I was more focused on the structure of the loom and how the mechanics worked. I will be excited to see a pre-made looms, that are made specifically for weaving and not reading :-)
