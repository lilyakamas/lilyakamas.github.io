<h3>Make your own loom</h3>
<h3>by Lily Kamas</h3>

<!-- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO18mP51RBI&t=1s
	Repeat the process to make a loom with the following specifications. 

	Your loom should have at least 20 ends/warps and use at least 2 colors. Weave two colors in any combination in the weft. Integrate at least 12" of conductive yarn or thread into the weave by any means you imagine. Weave something that relates to the contents of the book. Ask yourself, what else could you make a loom out of?  --> 

<p><h2>What are you setting out to do?</h2></p>
		<p> Before you start working, tell us where you are starting: Give us a 2-3 sentence description of what you think you might try and/or draw us a diagram of what you are going to make. Your description may include responses to any of the following: describe materials you’ll play with and why you chose those materials, if you have an idea of what you want to make, describe your vision. Describe what would you want to come out of this assignment and how would it be valuable to you? Did something in the reading inspire you? Did something you saw in the world give you an idea? Spoiler Alert, you will likely not get what you envision, and that’s the fun of it. Sometimes you just need a place to start but be generous and let yourself wander as new ideas come to mind.

		<p> For this experiment, I have collected some different types of <em>book weaver's (bookmark, chopstick</em>. I also chose my book, and it is the most recent book I've read, called <a href="https://www.fireflybooks.com/catalogue/adult-books/nature-and-science/marine-life/product/11538-great-white-shark-myth-and-reality "><em>"Great White Shark: Myth and Reality"</em></a>. Hopefully I can aquire some blue, silver and possibly wired types of weaving materials to show the story of this book, and sharks. </p>

<p><h2>Process Notes</h2></p>
		<p> Its critical to make observations and take time while you are exploring materials and techniques. We want to submit a collection (at least three, but more are welcome) of your notes on process. Each note should include a photo and an observation or idea that emerged.</p>

<p><h2>Reflection</h2></p>
		<p> A weekly that is generative would give you lots of ideas that you’d want to explore if you had the time. It would fuel visions of new things you’d like to make. A non-generative assignment might leave you feeling a bit blah, like you don’t feel like you really got much from the processes or you are feeling much more limited in what you think you might do next. Write 2-3 sentences reflecting on what you learned about the materials, how generative those findings were in your own creative process.
