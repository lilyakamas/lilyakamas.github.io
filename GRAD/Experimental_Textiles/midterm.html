<p><h2>Concept - "Woven Growth" 10/12 </h2></p>
		<!-- <p> Before you start working, tell us where you are starting: Give us a 2-3 sentence description of what you think you might try and/or draw us a diagram of what you are going to make. Your description may include responses to any of the following: describe materials you’ll play with and why you chose those materials, if you have an idea of what you want to make, describe your vision. Describe what would you want to come out of this assignment and how would it be valuable to you? Did something in the reading inspire you? Did something you saw in the world give you an idea? Spoiler Alert, you will likely not get what you envision, and that’s the fun of it. Sometimes you just need a place to start but be generous and let yourself wander as new ideas come to mind.</p> -->

				<!-- In deciding about what I wanted to accomplish through weaving I came up with a whole gaggle of ideas, but one stood out in particular. In class, we discussed how to weave an image, how to create the image through a draft on ADACAD, and what images are posssible to weave. One of my goals is to create a visually pleasing swatch/sample. Not knowing what image to use, I took to DALLE2 and typed in prompts regarding "primary colors in abrstact shapes". This prompt generated a few images that were potentially interesting to weave, as seen below. Ideally I would like to use four colors (including white) to create this piece. -->

				Throughout the process of deciding how I was going to quantify my midterm assignment, I came up with a gaggle of ideas. I thought the AI Generated Image would be the midterm project, but somewhere hidden in the honorable mentions regarded something far more interesting: <b> creating a woven structure that homes dirt and seeds, developing into an actual living & growing plant. </b> Being named after a flower, I have always felt a solid connection to plants and have conducted many research projects about plants growing from seedlings.


				<li>
					<b>I will try growing seedlings from a woven structure and use a metric of the seeds' growth ability/survivability.</b>
				</li>
			</li>
			<li>
				Draft: TBD but I will be using ADACAD to plan this :-) and I will use a pocket structure to place dirt/seeds inside the structure. 
			</li>
			<li>
				Materials:
				<ul>
					<li> Quick Sprouting Seeds</li>
					<li> Compressed Dirt </li>
					<li> Disolving/Water Soluable Yarn for Weft Pics</li>
					<li> Linen (potentially)</li>
					<li> Cotton Warp Ends</li>
				</ul>
