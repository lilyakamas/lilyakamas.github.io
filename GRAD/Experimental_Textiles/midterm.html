<h3>Midterm</h3>
<h3>Lily Kamas</h3>
<h6></h6>

<p><h2>What are you setting out to do?</h2></p>
		<!-- <p> Before you start working, tell us where you are starting: Give us a 2-3 sentence description of what you think you might try and/or draw us a diagram of what you are going to make. Your description may include responses to any of the following: describe materials you’ll play with and why you chose those materials, if you have an idea of what you want to make, describe your vision. Describe what would you want to come out of this assignment and how would it be valuable to you? Did something in the reading inspire you? Did something you saw in the world give you an idea? Spoiler Alert, you will likely not get what you envision, and that’s the fun of it. Sometimes you just need a place to start but be generous and let yourself wander as new ideas come to mind.</p> -->


<p><h2>Process Notes</h2></p>
		<p> Its critical to make observations and take time while you are exploring materials and techniques. We want to submit a collection (at least three, but more are welcome) of your notes on process. Each note should include a photo and an observation or idea that emerged.</p>
