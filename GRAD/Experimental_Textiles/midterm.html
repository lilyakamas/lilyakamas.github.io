<h1>Woven Growth - Midterm October 2022</h1>
<h3>Lily Kamas</h3>
<h6></h6>

<p><h2>Concept - 10/12 </h2></p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<!-- In deciding about what I wanted to accomplish through weaving I came up with a whole gaggle of ideas, but one stood out in particular. In class, we discussed how to weave an image, how to create the image through a draft on ADACAD, and what images are posssible to weave. One of my goals is to create a visually pleasing swatch/sample. Not knowing what image to use, I took to DALLE2 and typed in prompts regarding "primary colors in abrstact shapes". This prompt generated a few images that were potentially interesting to weave, as seen below. Ideally I would like to use four colors (including white) to create this piece. -->

				Throughout the process of deciding how I was going to quantify my midterm assignment, I came up with a gaggle of ideas. I thought the AI Generated Image would be the midterm project, but somewhere hidden in the honorable mentions regarded something far more interesting: <b> creating a woven structure that homes dirt and seeds, developing into an actual living & growing plant. </b> Being named after a flower, I have always felt a solid connection to plants and have conducted many research projects about plants growing from seedlings.


				<ul><li>
					<b>I will try growing seedlings from a woven structure and use a metric of the seeds' growth ability/survivability.</b>
				</ul></li>
			
			</li>
		</ul>
		
		<!--
			<li>
				Draft: TBD but I will be using ADACAD to plan this :-) and I will use a pocket structure to place dirt/seeds inside the structure. 
			</li>
			<li>
				Materials:
				<ul>
					<li> Quick Sprouting Seeds</li>
					<li> Compressed Dirt </li>
					<li> Disolving/Water Soluable Yarn for Weft Pics</li>
					<li> Linen (potentially)</li>
					<li> Cotton Warp Ends</li> 
				</ul>
		</ul>

<p><h2>Description, References, Circuitry</h2></p>

			<ul>
	<li> <b> Draft:</b> The draft and lift plan I used to create the pocket is inspired by the worksheet we accomplished in class. I used ADACad and my own lift plan notes to accomplish this on our in-class loom. I will only need four frames to complete this and I am using the secondly warped loom, with black and white warp yarn. The draft is shown below, I usually struggle with using and creating drafts so I handmade a platform that would allow for me to understand the draft process better. This also helps me to determine the lift plan and tie-up.  </li>
