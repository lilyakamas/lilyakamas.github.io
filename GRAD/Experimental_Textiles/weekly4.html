<!-- Each weekly will give you a prompt and a technique to use. In your assignment turn turn in, you’ll will describe what you did. This template is about process. Process means the journey you follow when attempting an assignment, not just the ending point. All the things that you do that go well, inspire a next step, or go not as you planed and either cause you to change your direction. All these experiences are equally valuable as long as we document and share them with each other. To borrow, again, from Corita Kent’s rules for an art studio, “the only rule is work”. With that in mind, we want you to submit the following for each of your weeklies: 

This week, try to weave something other than “yarn”. Ideas include tubing, monofilament, shape memory alloys, paper, elatic or others you might think of.

Use AdaCAD to design a compound structure to use when you work with this material.

Work with your partner to warp your loom with 1 - 2 yards of cloth, 4-5 inches wide at any density you wish (though 10 epi is probably best with the yarns we’ll give you). Create at least 4 shafts/harnesses (though this will largely depend on your structure…so coordinate with your partner)-->

		<!-- <p> Before you start working, tell us where you are starting: Give us a 2-3 sentence description of what you think you might try and/or draw us a diagram of what you are going to make. Your description may include responses to any of the following: describe materials you’ll play with and why you chose those materials, if you have an idea of what you want to make, describe your vision. Describe what would you want to come out of this assignment and how would it be valuable to you? Did something in the reading inspire you? Did something you saw in the world give you an idea? Spoiler Alert, you will likely not get what you envision, and that’s the fun of it. Sometimes you just need a place to start but be generous and let yourself wander as new ideas come to mind.</p> -->
<p>I have been thinking about weaving items other than yarn since one of the first days of class when someone mentioned potentially weaving with plants or even <em>snakeskin!</em> I actually have one snakeskin on hand; it's time to use it; the skin would yield some exciting results for flexibility and durability. </p>

<p><h2>Process Notes</h2></p>
		<p></p>

		<p>In class (9/14) on Wednesday, we learned about the weavers cross (warping in figure 8), and my partner and I began using four clamps to set up our warp. After about 20 strands, we inputted two chopstick-like figures to preserve the figure eight cross in the middle of our warp. Once we were finished weaving the warp around the clamps, we carried the warp over to our loom to connect them. After the warp was secured on the loom, we cut the end of the warp off and used a surgeon's knot to tighten the tension in the warp. On 9/19, we began by re-tensioning our warp and began to make hanging frames using large safety pins and chop-stick-like skewers. After the safety pins had been securely attached to each warp, we set up each frame by inputting the skewer into the safety pins. On Wednesday(9/21), we decided to scrap the safety-pin frames entirely and instead try string heddles as we did on the Book Loom. My partner and I worked together to thread the string through each warp on our loom. This technique was easier, faster, and more effective than the safety-pin method.</p>

<p><h2>Reflection</h2></p>
		<p>Draft creation and understanding have always confused me, so I pushed myself to learn more about how to read and write drafts correctly. 
		Another struggle was using the large safety pins to create a frame that moved the warp. The warp strands were a bit too small to stick in the eyelet, so we struggled to be able to push the frame up and down. Our warp still had some tension issues at this point, which made starting a weft more challenging. I enjoyed working with the different materials; however, the vines were practically impossible to work with because of their inability to bend easily and the plastic type of material holding them together. My favorite part of the weave was using the snake shed, it was incredibly fragile, so I decided to thread a piece of string through it in case it degrades over time or becomes frail due to the tension. It was so beautiful and fun to work with! I needed help using all the frames effectively, especially with large pieces of material. A stronger shed stick would help that, as well as finding the right length and tension for the string frames. </p> 

<!-- A weekly that is generative would give you lots of ideas that you’d want to explore if you had the time. It would fuel visions of new things you’d like to make. A non-generative assignment might leave you feeling a bit blah, like you don’t feel like you really got much from the processes or you are feeling much more limited in what you think you might do next. Write 2-3 sentences reflecting on what you learned about the materials, how generative those findings were in your own creative process. -->
