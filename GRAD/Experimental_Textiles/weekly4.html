<!-- Each weekly will give you a prompt and a technique to use. In your assignment turn turn in, you’ll will describe what you did. This template is about process. Process means the journey you follow when attempting an assignment, not just the ending point. All the things that you do that go well, inspire a next step, or go not as you planed and either cause you to change your direction. All these experiences are equally valuable as long as we document and share them with each other. To borrow, again, from Corita Kent’s rules for an art studio, “the only rule is work”. With that in mind, we want you to submit the following for each of your weeklies: 

This week, try to weave something other than “yarn”. Ideas include tubing, monofilament, shape memory alloys, paper, elatic or others you might think of.

Use AdaCAD to design a compound structure to use when you work with this material.

Work with your partner to warp your loom with 1 - 2 yards of cloth, 4-5 inches wide at any density you wish (though 10 epi is probably best with the yarns we’ll give you). Create at least 4 shafts/harnesses (though this will largely depend on your structure…so coordinate with your partner)-->

<p><h2>What are you setting out to do?</h2></p>
		<!-- <p> Before you start working, tell us where you are starting: Give us a 2-3 sentence description of what you think you might try and/or draw us a diagram of what you are going to make. Your description may include responses to any of the following: describe materials you’ll play with and why you chose those materials, if you have an idea of what you want to make, describe your vision. Describe what would you want to come out of this assignment and how would it be valuable to you? Did something in the reading inspire you? Did something you saw in the world give you an idea? Spoiler Alert, you will likely not get what you envision, and that’s the fun of it. Sometimes you just need a place to start but be generous and let yourself wander as new ideas come to mind.</p> -->
<p>Weaving items other than yarn is something I have been thinking about since one of the first days of class, when someone mentioned potentially weaving with plants, or even <em>snakeskin!</em> Funnily enough, I actually have one snakeskin on hand; I think it's time to use it. I also have been collecting some of the leaf fronds from one of my dying plants (RIP), but it would yeild some interesting results forf flexibility and durability. </p>

<p><h2>Process Notes</h2></p>
		<p> Its critical to make observations and take time while you are exploring materials and techniques. We want to submit a collection (at least three, but more are welcome) of your notes on process. Each note should include a photo and an observation or idea that emerged.</p>

		<p>In class (9/14) on Wednesday, we learned about the weavers cross (warping in a figure 8) and my partner and I began using four clamps to set up our warp. After about 20 strands, we inputted two chopstick-like figures to preserve the figure eight cross in the middle of our warp. Once we were finished weaving the warp around the clamps, we carried the warp over to our loom to connect them together. After the warp was secured on the loom, we cut the end of the warp and used a surgeons knot to tighten the tension in the warp. .

<p><h2>Reflection</h2></p>
		<p> 

<!-- A weekly that is generative would give you lots of ideas that you’d want to explore if you had the time. It would fuel visions of new things you’d like to make. A non-generative assignment might leave you feeling a bit blah, like you don’t feel like you really got much from the processes or you are feeling much more limited in what you think you might do next. Write 2-3 sentences reflecting on what you learned about the materials, how generative those findings were in your own creative process. -->
