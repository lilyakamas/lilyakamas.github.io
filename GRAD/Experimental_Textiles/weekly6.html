<!-- This weekly is a 2-week weekly that will consist of several parts. Complete the following:

Complete the reverse drafting worksheet with a swatch that will be provided to you in class. Follow each step on the worksheet carefully and make notes and comments about what you learned through this process in your weekly write up. 

Please bring your physical worksheet to class on Oct 10 for grading as part of this weekly.

Find a different woven sample and try to come up with an explanation of how it was drafted. What structures were used in what combinations. Use terminology from weaving in your explaination such as (interlacement, float, tabby, twill, satin)


Spend 2 hours weaving on the 8-shaft loom (an appointment calendar is available via Canvas). Listen to your favorite album, weave something that reminds you of the music. Focus on the feel, giving yourself room to play. Leave your work on the loom and weave a 2" tabby header after your work to prep the loom for the next person. Include images of what you made and how you went about doing it

Bonus: As you weave on the 8 shaft, somehow integrate two separate conductive yarns such that when you move the swatch (fold, stretch, twist), the two threads connect and conduct electricity. Include images of what you made and how you went about doing it --> 

<h3>Weekly 5/6: Embodying Weave Structure, Making Swatches, October 10th</h3>

<h6> This page is split into two parts, worksheet first and then the 8-frame loom. </h6>

<p><h2>In the beginning... of the worksheet... </h2></p>
<ul> <!-- creating bullet points x-->
	<li>Structuring and planning drafts have not come easily to me in the past, so I am looking forward to learning how to reverse drafts. This will be a valuable tool for me in the future, especially if I plan to make a reverse draft from an AI-generated image in the future...</li>
</ul>

<p><h2>Worksheet Process Notes</h2></p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<p><b>Drawdown - </b> We started by picking swatches in class, and I decided on a swatch with contrasting colors so I could easily see the differences between the warp and weft. After photographing the swatch, picking off a few adjacent sides, and orienting the swatch, I moved the green weft pics with a pin. I was doing well until the eighth row when I accidentally pulled out one of the warp ends with a weft pic. This is noted in my worksheet, but using ADACAD, I did 'predict' how the draft would've looked like with the warp end. As I got to the last four rows of weft pics, the weave was quite loose, and I was worried about the final row falling out, so I drafted all four rows together without removing the weft pics. It was a bit complicated but using my pin to hold my place helped immensely. <b> Lift Plan - </b> Throughout creating the lift plan, I was unsure if I was doing it right, and I had a lot of self-doubt as to whether I was correct. At one point, I tried a new technique that I thought would help, but it ended up creating an inverse of the draft, and I think something else is needed. I'll need some more help on the techniques of writing lift plans before I am ready to recreate something on the loom. <b> Threading - </b> Finishing up the threading is the last thing I do before I move on to the Color Chart. The tie-up tells us how the warps are tied on the loom, and helps us double check to see if the drawdown was complete. I used the ADACad provided to help determine where my swatch lined up on the warp ends. <b> Color Chart - </b> For added effect, I tried to color each square in the direction that the yarn/thread would go, but it was easy to get carried away because I like dark squares so you can see the color. I decided to do the color chart of how it would be if there were no missed lines in the draft or missing warp threads, so it looks more like the original piece. </p>

<p><h2>Worksheet Reflection</h2></p>

			<ul>
	<li>I thouroughly enjoyed doing a reverse draft, even though the process was quite challenging. In the weave, I found <em> tabby, twill (2/1) and basket weaves </em> in my swatch. One of the lessons I learned which I will bring into the future is to use a pencil with an eraser instead of pen or sharpie, as I am prone to make mistakes and going back to edit them is easier with an eraser. I tried to make edits on the draft with pen, but it quickly got messy and difficult to read. In addition, the most difficult part of the draft was after one of the warps were removed from the swatch. After that, it was difficult to tell how the pattern was supposed to go, and I needed to make sure that I didn't mark it on the draft - so I didn't miscount the rest of the warp ends. After completing the drawdown and lift plan, I used ADACAD to check my work. Based on what ADACAD told me, the loom could not complete the swatch with this draft. I felt relatively confident in my draft until I went and checked in ADACAD. I would like to see what an the correct draft looks like, as well as how I can better use ADACAD to draft swatches correctly. If I was to make one update to ADACAD, it would be to include an 'undo' button, as well as similar keyboard shortcuts. These additions would help the website be more intutive. </li>

			<!-- A weekly that is generative would give you lots of ideas that you’d want to explore if you had the time. It would fuel visions of new things you’d like to make. A non-generative assignment might leave you feeling a bit blah, like you don’t feel like you really got much from the processes or you are feeling much more limited in what you think you might do next. Write 2-3 sentences reflecting on what you learned about the materials, how generative those findings were in your own creative process. -->
