<!-- This weekly is a 2-week weekly that will consist of several parts. Complete the following:

Complete the reverse drafting worksheet with a swatch that will be provided to you in class. Follow each step on the worksheet carefully and make notes and comments about what you learned through this process in your weekly write up. 

Please bring your physical worksheet to class on Oct 10 for grading as part of this weekly.

Find a different woven sample and try to come up with an explanation of how it was drafted. What structures were used in what combinations. Use terminology from weaving in your explaination such as (interlacement, float, tabby, twill, satin)


Spend 2 hours weaving on the 8-shaft loom (an appointment calendar is available via Canvas). Listen to your favorite album, weave something that reminds you of the music. Focus on the feel, giving yourself room to play. Leave your work on the loom and weave a 2" tabby header after your work to prep the loom for the next person. Include images of what you made and how you went about doing it

Bonus: As you weave on the 8 shaft, somehow integrate two separate conductive yarns such that when you move the swatch (fold, stretch, twist), the two threads connect and conduct electricity. Include images of what you made and how you went about doing it --> 

<h3>Weekly 5/6: Embodying Weave Structure, Making Swatches, October 10th</h3>
<h3>Lily Kamas</h3>

<p><h2>In the beginning...</h2></p>
<ul> <!-- creating bullet points x-->
	<li>Worksheet: Structuring and planning drafts have not come easily to me in the past, so I am looking forward to learning how to reverse drafts. This will be a valuable tool for me in the future, especially if I plan to make a reverse draft from an AI-generated image in the future...</li>

</ul>

<p><h2>Process Notes</h2></p>
<ul>
	<li>Worksheet: 
		<p>Drawdown - We started by picking swatches in class, and I decided on a swatch with contrasting colors so I could easily see the differences between the warp and weft. After photographing the swatch, picking off a few adjacent sides, and orienting the swatch, I moved the green weft pics with a pin. I was doing well until the eighth row when I accidentally pulled out one of the warp ends with a weft pic. This is noted in my worksheet, but using ADACAD, I did 'predict' how the draft would've looked like with the warp end. As I got to the last four rows of weft pics, the weave was quite loose, and I was worried about the final row falling out, so I drafted all four rows together without removing the weft pics. It was a bit complicated but using my pin to hold my place helped immensely. </p>

<p><h2>Reflection</h2></p>
		<p>
			<ul>
	<li>Worksheet: After completing the drawdown and lift plan, I used ADACad to check my work. Based on what ADACad told me, the loom could not complete the swatch with this draft. I felt relatively confident in my draft until I went and checked in ADACad </li>
