		<p> As I watched ‘Lost’ reruns late Monday night, I watched a scene from Exodus, Part 1, that was <em>genuinely</em> touching. At this moment, I knew what I wanted to present my idea to three different groups of people. The audiences I have chosen are dog-lovers, ‘Lost’ fans, and TV producers. Each of these audiences has different characteristics and perspectives I would like to address and ‘produce’ something to help each audience. I am presenting the argument that Vincent is the best character in the hit 2000’s show, ‘Lost.’ </p>


		<p> Starting with dog-lovers, one of my favorite audiences, I plan on creating a reveal.js slide deck with photos, facts, as well as full scene clips of our favorite pooch. This show will immerse the audience in all things Vincent. Once this is completely filled out with all things Vincent, hopefully, the adorably heartfelt connection they feel to Vincent will make them want to watch the show. 
		While there isn’t much-published data collected on Vincent, it would be easy to create a youtube playlist of all the episodes Vincent was featured in. The first episode Vincent is featured in is the Pilot, which is widely regarded as one of the best Pilots, according to ‘Lost’ fans.</p>

		<p>‘Lost’ is not a short or necessarily easy show to understand. The dramatic and somewhat confusing ending made many ready to rewatch the entire six-season show all over again. I want to create an extensive HTML page with custom CSS to display all the pertinent information for these fans. While I would initially like to start with Vincent and his statistics, I would like to continue by adding a page for each character. Once all of the characters and episodes are accounted for, I would move on to factoids about the show, possibly a theories forum as well. This would be the best for fans who want to look up facts on the fly, on their phones while they are watching their favorite show</p> 

		<p> Finally, TV producers are always trying to find more ways to connect with the audience, and as the Slide Deck and HTML page show, people are crazy about Vincent. So what does that mean for tv producers? Besides collecting data from the actual TV show, I plan on putting surveys in those two productions, asking what their feelings are towards dogs in tv shows. Armed with this data and the data collected from ‘Lost’, I will create an extensive portfolio analyzing the collected data results. With these complex and in-depth visualizations, it will be easy for producers to see that people enjoy watching shows that have dogs in them. This realization will allow the producers to add more dogs into future TV shows, making it a more pleasurable viewing experience for everyone.</p>

		<p> Of course, this all would not be possible without Vincent and the 43 episodes he brought light to. Thank you, Vincent, and thank you ‘Lost’. This year, Madison, the dog who played Vincent, will be turning 21. I wish her all of the love in the world. </p>
