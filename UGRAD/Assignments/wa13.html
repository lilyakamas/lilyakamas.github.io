		<h1 id="title">DOGE COIN VISUALIZATIONS</h1>
		<!-- <h2 id="subtitle">Fact or Fiction?</h2> -->

		<div class="paragraph">			
		<p></p>
		<p> In early January, we all laughed about the GameStonk Culture and the stock market crashing, now, it's coming back once again. This 'fake' stock has been in the stock market for sometime, and it is only growing. My thesis is: that dogecoin and seattle weather may be realted. In this day and age of data and collection, some may want us to find out the correlation between multiple things.</p>

		
		<h2 id="subtitle">Visualization 1</h2>
	
		<div id="dogecoin-vis"></div>
     	<script type="text/javascript">
        var spec = {

           "$schema": "https://vega.github.io/schema/vega-lite/v5.json",
            "width": 700,
            "height": 400,
            "data": {
              "url": "https://pkgstore.datahub.io/cryptocurrency/dogecoin/dogecoin_csv/data/492e9a6143d017e8eb08c08ae0006b34/dogecoin_csv.csv"
            },

            "mark": "line",

            "encoding": {
              "x": {
                  "field": "date",
                  "type": "temporal"
              },
              "y": {
                  "field": "price(USD)",
                  "type": "quantitative",
                  //"timeUnit": "year"
              },
            },
          };
        /* JSON dump of your chart's spec */
        var opt = {"renderer": "canvas", "actions": false};  /* Options for the embedding */
        vegaEmbed("#dogecoin-vis", spec, opt);
      </script>

		<p>For this first Visualization, I compare the date, as well as the price in US Dollars. As you can see in this line graph, there are ups and downs to each month, in every year. However, you can see that more recently the price has been going up, but that was over four years ago. The data does not reach today for some reason, even though it is most active today. </p>
		<p>                     


		</p>
		<p> I am compairing DogeCoin to Seatle Weather, you can find the data <a href="https://github.com/vega/vega-datasets/blob/master/data/seattle-weather.csv">here</a>. The data looks at date, precipitation, temp_max, temp_min, wind and weather. For the purpose of the visualizations, I will be comparing the percipitation level as well as the date. This will make it easiest to create and understand the visualization. </p>

		<h2 id="subtitle">Visualization 2</h2>
		<div id="vis02"></div>
      	<script type="text/javascript">
        var spec = {

           "$schema": "https://vega.github.io/schema/vega-lite/v4.json",
            "width": 700,
            "height": 350,
            "data": {
              "url": "https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/seattle-weather.csv"
            },
            "encoding": {
              "x": {
                  "field": "date",
                  "type": "temporal",
                  //"timeUnit": "year",
              },
              "y": {
                  "field": "precipitation",
                  "type": "quantitative"
              }
            },
            "mark": "bar"
          };
        /* JSON dump of your chart's spec */
        var opt = {"renderer": "canvas", "actions": false};  /* Options for the embedding */
        vegaEmbed("#vis02", spec, opt);
      </script>

		<p>In conclusion, it does not seem like the weather in Seattle has little if any impact on the price of DogeCoin. Of course, we could always specualte that in October 2016, because it had little percipation during that time, the price of DogeCoin rose, creating a small rift in in the graph around October 2016. In early April of 2014, however, the high percipiation may have caused a SPIKE in the price of DogeCoin. I wonder, peer reviewer, if you are really reading this, if you are please give me a 20/20. I am so tired. </p>

 <!-- Integrate the skills you've learned this semester into a single assignment.

 Make a single page with a nice CSS framework (like Bootstrap from Weekly Assignment 6) with a five-paragraph persuasive essay (like Weekly Assignment 2) about what the price of DogeCoin reveals about... anything. DogeCoin (Links to an external site.) 

is inherently silly so this assignment and the "anything" you compare DogeCoin can be as serious or silly as you want. You can compare it to other cryptocurrencies, financial/economic behavior, online culture, CO2 emissions, or whatever you want to write a data-driven argument about. 

Include at least two Vega visualizations in your essay: one about DogeCoin and the other about the "anything." Historical price and volume data about DogeCoin is available from Yahoo! Finance (Links to an external site.) or from this file on Canvas  download. You will need to use the skills we discuss on Wednesday, April 21 about hosting data to read into Vega.

Have a webpage that uses a professional CSS framework (Links to an external site.) like Bootstrap
Write a five-paragraph persuasive essay with thesis, evidence, and conclusions relating DogeCoin to anything
Make one visualization using the DogeCoin historical price and volume data
Make one visualization using data about the anything
Submit the URL of the GitHub page where you are hosting your essay.
