<!-- Consult the documentation to improve the interactivity of your chart. The easiest way to do this is to add nice tooltips, but you can also add things like click interactions using Javascript events. Consult the docs for whichever library you end up using.
You must include a final version of your chart under a section called version 3.
Interactivity is one huge advantage of showing plots over the web instead of in a PDF or in a notebook.
You should explain in text how you added interactivity and what (if anything) this adds to the plot -->

<!-- Includes a plot and description of interactivity. -->
