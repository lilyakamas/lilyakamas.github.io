<!-- Integrate the skills you've learned this semester into a single assignment.

 Make a single page with a nice CSS framework (like Bootstrap from Weekly Assignment 6) with a five-paragraph persuasive essay (like Weekly Assignment 2) about what the price of DogeCoin reveals about... anything. DogeCoin (Links to an external site.) 

is inherently silly so this assignment and the "anything" you compare DogeCoin can be as serious or silly as you want. You can compare it to other cryptocurrencies, financial/economic behavior, online culture, CO2 emissions, or whatever you want to write a data-driven argument about. 

Include at least two Vega visualizations in your essay: one about DogeCoin and the other about the "anything." Historical price and volume data about DogeCoin is available from Yahoo! Finance (Links to an external site.) or from this file on Canvas  download. You will need to use the skills we discuss on Wednesday, April 21 about hosting data to read into Vega.

Have a webpage that uses a professional CSS framework (Links to an external site.) like Bootstrap
Write a five-paragraph persuasive essay with thesis, evidence, and conclusions relating DogeCoin to anything
Make one visualization using the DogeCoin historical price and volume data
Make one visualization using data about the anything
Submit the URL of the GitHub page where you are hosting your essay.
