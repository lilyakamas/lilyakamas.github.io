<!-- 		Step One 
You should write Python code to compute some statistic based on the Denver police data (e.g. mean, max, etc.). For instance, in class, we looked at the probability that the Denver police made an arrest after a vehicular stop vs. a pedestrian stop. To compute your statistic, you must perform:

Filtering (i.e. divide the data into groups of some kind)
Aggregation (i.e. compute some statistic on the data in each group)
You should commit your data analysis code to your GitHub repo and link to the code in your assignment. 

Then you should write a few sentences briefly describing your code. Be sure to briefly specify how you performed filtering and aggregation.



			Step Two
You should make a custom chart based on the data you compute. To do this, you will need to write the statistic you compute to a JSON file and load that JSON file into Chart.js to make a chart, like we practiced in class.

If you want to use another library (e.g. Altair) that renders a chart using HTML/CSS/JS you are welcome to do so. But make sure your chart is actual HTML/CSS/JS (not a static image embedded into a webpage using an img tag).

Include your chart on your web page.




			Step Three
Briefly analyze and interpret your findings. What might they mean? For instance, say the Denver police are more likely to make an arrest after a pedestrian stop. What would this indicate? What are possible explanations? Think through a number of different ways to explain the data. For instance, maybe the police get called for different reasons when they make a pedestrian stop vs. a vehicle stop (leading to different arrest rates). End your analysis by describing another question that you might ask in the future to gain a deeper understanding of your question.
