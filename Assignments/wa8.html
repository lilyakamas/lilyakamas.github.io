<!-- 		Step One 
You should write Python code to compute some statistic based on the Denver police data (e.g. mean, max, etc.). For instance, in class, we looked at the probability that the Denver police made an arrest after a vehicular stop vs. a pedestrian stop. To compute your statistic, you must perform:

Filtering (i.e. divide the data into groups of some kind)
Aggregation (i.e. compute some statistic on the data in each group)
You should commit your data analysis code to your GitHub repo and link to the code in your assignment. 

Then you should write a few sentences briefly describing your code. Be sure to briefly specify how you performed filtering and aggregation.

Step Two
You should make a custom chart based on the data you compute. To do this, you will need to write the statistic you compute to a JSON file and load that JSON file into Chart.js to make a chart, like we practiced in class.

If you want to use another library (e.g. Altair) that renders a chart using HTML/CSS/JS you are welcome to do so. But make sure your chart is actual HTML/CSS/JS (not a static image embedded into a webpage using an img tag).

Include your chart on your web page.

Step Three
Briefly analyze and interpret your findings. What might they mean? For instance, say the Denver police are more likely to make an arrest after a pedestrian stop. What would this indicate? What are possible explanations? Think through a number of different ways to explain the data. For instance, maybe the police get called for different reasons when they make a pedestrian stop vs. a vehicle stop (leading to different arrest rates). End your analysis by describing another question that you might ask in the future to gain a deeper understanding of your question. -->

		<h2>Statistics </h2>
		<p>Using the code set up in class, I created an aggregation function to determine a statistic about the data. The statistic computed is like the probability of arrest per precinct. In the code, loaded the CSV line by line, and each line is converted into an array of field values. After I grouped those elements per precinct in a dictionary, for each precinct in the dictionary, I iterate through all of its records, see if a particular record is an arrest, and increment the total for that precinct. Finally, I computed the percentage of number of arrests over the total records for that precinct. I saved the computed values in a dictionary and dumped them into a JSON file for the chart in Step #2.

		<!-- The submission (1) computes a statistic using filtering and aggregation (2) links to the code and (3) explains the code -->
	
		<h2>Visualizations </h2>
		<p>I created a bar graph for the custom chart that depicts the probability of being arrested per precinct. I copied the JSON data into the HTML folder, and I dynamically loaded it in the chart, including data and labels. Then I dynamically generated the colors on random.</p> 
		<h3>Arrest Probability Per Denver Precinct</h3><!-- insert chart here -->

		style="display: block; height: 245px; width: 980px;"
		>
		
		</canvas>

		<!-- The submission successfully makes and presents a polished chart based on the statistic. The axis are appropriately scaled, there is a legend if appropriate, the chart has a title, etc. -->

		<h2>Anaylsis </h2>
		<p>We can see a few outliers in our data through the analysis of this data. In some precincts, their arrest rate is upwards of 25%, which is relatively high. These precincts may be located in more dangerous or active communities. Some precincts, however, seem to have low probability rates, which suggests those areas may have less police presence. There is one more exciting outlier for precinct '759'. They have no arrests on record. Now, this could be a mishap from the data.. or is it? For future research, I ask, "Is there a geographical correlation between these numbers?". I could not do this in my project because the lat/lon data represents where the incident took place, not where the precinct station is. I would also ask, "what types of arrests are most common?", do some precincts have more vehicle accidents that lead to more arrests? Future research will be needed to determine these answers.</p>
