		      <div class="accordion-body">The Wicked Problems project guided the teams through identifying a problem, background research, working with a community leader within the wicked problem, observing leadership in action, and presenting the findings to our own leadership community. Out of the many possible Wicked Problems presented to us, I decided to go with the one I felt most passionate about, Climate Change. I was introduced to my group and suggested we use something like a Team Charter, similar to the one I used in Group Interaction. After learning about signs of overconfidence, close-mindedness, and group pressure, I wanted to make sure that everyone in the group felt heard by being patient and flexible and seeking areas of agreement (Johnson, 2005). Soon after, we all started working together, though I felt as if innovation and collective leadership were low as I pulled us through the assignments. The group had fallen into a state of atrophy, and I was feeling the burnout (Rego & Gergen, 2017). However, after being honest with my group about how I feel and my recent personal struggles, they all took the initiative. Since then, I have felt more secure with higher collective leadership but still low in innovation. Leading to the overall group feel to be cohesion and stagnation (Rego & Gergen, 2017). As of now, the semester isn't over, and we still have our findings to present to our peers, so I have hope in my group that we will finish out this fantastic opportunity.
