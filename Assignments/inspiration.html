		<p> There are some very interesting links that lead me to this inspiration. For instance <a href="https://lilykamas.com/">this website</a> helped me understand a possible overall look for my portfolio. While not made in BootStrap, this SquareSpace website is incredible and comes together nicely. This polished look is what I desire for the future. </p>



		<p>This interactive portfolio is built for the user. <a href="https://sanprieto.es/">Ricardo Sanprieto</a> created this moving website to display his numerous talents. My favorite part? Drag your mouse on the home page... look familiar? I would love to see Abe code that!</p>
			
		<p>When I googled "Famous Data Scientist Portfolios" something incredible happened-- it showed the search results for it. In those top links I discovered numerous examples and inpriation for my own website. In <a href="https://donnemartin.com/#portfolio">Donne Martin’s portfolio page,</a> he makes his GitHub loud and proud, displaying that his code and repositories are a good source for his work. I plan on adding my own projects soon to my website. <a href="https://www.hannahyan.com">Hannah Yan Han’s portfolio</a> and <a href="https://www.claudiatenhoope.com">Claudia Ten Hoope’s website</a> took a different approach which I had not considered, simple. They don't have huge photos of their face and focus on their work and their simple design. I wish to incooporate some of those simplicities into my work as well.</p>

		<p>Honestly, I have been truly blessed to see my peers work. It has been one of my favorite parts of this class, because you all have such great ideas! Often times, these professional looking websites are daunting, and way more complex than what we've learned in class. Seeing y'alls work helps me imagine what we can accomplish! So, thank you for being an inspirtation. </p>


<!-- create a way to hold data on the website? I want my peers to be able to drop their work too?  -->
