		<p> There are some very interesting links that lead me to this inspiration. For instance <a href="https://lilykamas.com/">this website</a> helped me understand a possible overall look for my portfolio. While not made in BootStrap, this SquareSpace website is incredible and comes together nicely. This polished look is what I desire for the future. </p>
