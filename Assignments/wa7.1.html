<!-- In this section you should explain how you read in the data from the CSV file. The easiest way to do this is to commit the code for reading in the data to GitHub and link to the code.
You can copy and paste the data into your chart, or figure out how to read it in from a file. Either is acceptable. Learning to read in from a file is good practice.
You may want to wrangle (Links to an external site.) the data using methods from 3401 or hand-written Python code (e.g. filtering by day, or aggregating by hour) but this is not required. Describe any manipulations that you perform in this section.
You must include an initial version of your chart under a section called version 1.
Extra credit: It is possible to create websites that show nicely formatted Python code, like in Jupyter or codeshare or any other coding environment. For extra credit, figure out how to do this on your website and include code snippets showing how you manipulated the data. If you complete the extra credit, please email the instructors to let us know. -->
