		<p>The 'meme' culture has also blossomed during these times, and even the GameStop stocks and other similar ones, like DogeCoin, have been called 'Meme Stocks'. For the first time in some of these people's lives, because of their trading, they have been able to purchase medicine for their family and pay off student loans. One meme that was posted, entitled "Reactions to the GameStop Short Squeeze" described the four views of our poltical system: Authoritarian, Economic-Left, Economic-Right, and Libretarian, with the Wall Street Investors, in the middle. </p>

			<blockquote> "There once was a stock that put to sea, the name of the stock was $GME, the price went up and the shorts dipped down, Hold my bully boys, hold. 
			[chorus] Soon may the Tendieman come, to send our rocket into the sun. One day, when the trading is done, we'll take our gains and go. 
			She had not been two weeks from shore, when Ryan Cohen joined the board, the captin called all hands and swore he'd take his shares and hold.
			[chorus]
			Before the news had hit the market, WSB came up and bought it, with diamond hands, they knew they'd profit, if only they could hold. 
			[chorus]" </blockquote>
