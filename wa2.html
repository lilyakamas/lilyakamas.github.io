		Additionally, Sea Shantys have become largely popular due to social media. Circulating the internet, came this rendition of what happened to $GME. 
			"There once was a stock that put to sea, the name of the stock was $GME, the price went up and the shorts dipped down, Hold my bully boys, hold. 
			[chorus] Soon may the Tendieman come, to send our rocket into the sun. One day, when the trading is done, we'll take our gains and go. 
			She had not been two weeks from shore, when Ryan Cohen joined the board, the captin called all hands and swore he'd take his shares and hold.
			[chorus]
			Before the news had hit the market, WSB came up and bought it, with diamond hands, they knew they'd profit, if only they could hold. 
			[chorus]"
		Origionally written by user @geosaris on TikTok, this GameStonk song went viral.
